**NYXBins** is a list containing a collection of Unix binaries that can be used to circumvent local security restrictions on misconfigured systems.

The project documents legitimate functionalities of common Unix binaries that, when abused, can be used to escape restricted shells, escalate or maintain elevated privileges, transfer files, spawn bind or reverse shells, and assist in a variety of post-exploitation tasks.

**NYXBins** is **not a collection of exploits**. The binaries listed here are not vulnerable; rather, **NYXBins** focuses on survivability techniques, showing how both attackers and defenders can operate using only the tools already available on the target system.

Born as a fork and evolution of [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io), **NYXBins** aims to expand, refine, and modernize the catalog with new techniques, improved documentation, and a community-driven approach.

**NYXBins** is a completely open and [collaborative](https://github.com/vulnyx/vulnyx.github.io/graphs/contributors) project, which welcomes [contributions](/contribute/) of new binaries, methods or improvements of all kinds.
